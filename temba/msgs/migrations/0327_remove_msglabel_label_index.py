# Drops the plain index on msgs_msg_labels.label_id. Everything which lists a label's messages now reads msgs_by_label
# (added in 0326), which has label_id as its leading column and so serves a lookup by label alone as well, leaving
# this one only costing space and write overhead. This has to run after the services which read labellings by label
# alone have been deployed with that change.
#
# The index isn't a named index in the migration state - it's the one Django creates for a foreign key - so it's
# found and dropped here directly, with the state change (db_index=False) made separately. It's found by its
# definition rather than by name: on a database whose table predates Django's current index naming scheme it has a
# different name to the one Django would give it now, and a drop by that name would silently do nothing. Dropping
# concurrently means it doesn't block writes, which is why this migration isn't atomic. Installations large enough to
# care can do it by hand ahead of the deploy and fake this migration:
#
#   SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'msgs_msg_labels' AND indexdef LIKE '% USING btree (label_id)';
#   DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY <that index>;
#

# what Django would name the index, used when reversing
