    # like the Android index replaced in 0320, the index used to find messages to retry has status in its predicate,
    # so every status change on an outgoing message has to update it even when nothing it changed is indexed - which
    # is what stops Postgres applying those updates as heap-only tuple (HOT) updates.
    #
    # This replaces it with one on next_attempt being set, which is the case only whilst a message is awaiting a
    # retry. Mailroom and courier maintain that: every transition that moves a message on clears it. 0322 clears the
    # stale values left on messages written before that held.
    #
    # Unlike the Android replacement, this one has no deploy order dependency. The query that uses it filters
    # next_attempt <= NOW(), which implies this predicate's next_attempt IS NOT NULL, so Postgres can serve the
    # existing query from this index during the transition and the old one can be dropped in 0323 either side of the
    # service deploy.
    #
    # An index build on the messages table can't hold ACCESS EXCLUSIVE for its duration, so it's created
    # concurrently. Installations large enough to care can build it by hand ahead of the deploy and fake this:
    #
    #   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY msgs_outgoing_awaiting_retry ON msgs_msg (next_attempt, created_on, id)
    #   WHERE direction = 'O' AND next_attempt IS NOT NULL;
    #
