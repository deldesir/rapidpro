# Archived is no longer a message visibility - it's recorded by Msg.folder alone, which is what everything reads to tell
# whether a message is archived. Mailroom and courier no longer write it, so this clears the value from the messages
# that predate that, leaving visibility to mean only visible or deleted and letting the value itself be removed.
#
# Almost all of these rows are archived messages, which keep folder 'A' and stay archived - only the redundant second
# record of that fact goes. The exception is a message archived while it was still unhandled, which carries visibility
# 'A' with folder 'P' because being unhandled takes precedence over being archived. Such a message isn't in the
# Archived folder and, now that handling one no longer consults visibility, wouldn't be filed there when handled
# either, so clearing its visibility makes the row say what the rest of the system already believes about it.
#
# No counts move, so this doesn't need a quiet window. The folder counts are keyed on folder, and the label counts on
# whether the folder is archived or deleted, so an update which leaves folder alone moves neither.
#
# The table is far too large to scan for the messages needing this, so we walk the primary key range in batches
# instead, newest first. Each batch is its own transaction, so an interrupted run can be resumed from the last id it
# reported. See the note in 0310_backfill_msg_folder on choosing the batch size by what one statement should cost
# rather than by the id range it covers - the same per row and per statement triggers apply here.

BATCH_SIZE = 10_000  # ids per batch, not rows - ids are sparse wherever messages have been deleted

# the visibility test is part of the statement, so the triggers see a batch sized by the rows actually cleared rather
# than by the ids walked
